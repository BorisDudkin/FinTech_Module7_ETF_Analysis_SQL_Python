## Technologies

`Python 3.9`

`Jupyter lab`

_Prerequisites_

1. Pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with large sets of data easy and intuitive.

- [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - For the documentation, installation guide and dependencies.

2. PyViz is a Python visualization package that provides a single platform for accessing multiple visualization libraries. Two of these libraries are hvPlot and GeoViews.<br/> The [hvPlot ](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) and [GeoViews ](https://geoviews.org/) libraries are visualization libraries that are designed to work with Pandas DataFrames and that we can use to create interactive plots for our data.

- [PyViz ](https://pyviz.org/) - For guidance on how to start visualization, interactive visualization, styles and layouts customazation.
